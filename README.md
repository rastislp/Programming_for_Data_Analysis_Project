Scoope of this project is to create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon.Then, rather than collect datarelated to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.


Specifically, in this project you should:
• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
