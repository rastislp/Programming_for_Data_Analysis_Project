Scope of this project is to create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon.Then, rather than collect datarelated to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.


Specifically, in this project you should:
• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

## The Old Continent: how money buys success on the pitch

In last decade on old continent, we have only seen 5 football teams from England, Germany, and Spain to win Champion league final. If there are 51 countries in continental Europe why winners are coming only from three of them. What is more interesting is a fact that 3 out of 5 teams has won trophy more than just once. What is behind such a sport **phenomenon**? Luck, talent, money or something else.
